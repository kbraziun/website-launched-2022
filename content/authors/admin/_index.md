There is a critical need to understand how climate change and disturbance regimes will impact forested landscapes and how land managers and residents can navigate changing conditions. My core research examines relationships between climate, disturbances, forest ecosystems, fire risk in the wildland urban interface, and ecosystem services during the 21st century, with a focus on mountain landscapes in the western United States and the European Alps. I aim to pursue research in collaboration with and relevant to land managers; to create reproducible science; to foster meaningful and respectful relationships with colleagues and collaborators; and to support diversity and inclusion in science.
